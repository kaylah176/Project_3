# Project 3
## Project Overview: 

Project 3: Tokenization and Real Estate is an MVP which does the following: Enables transaction of an asset as an NFT. For this Minimum-Viable-Product, we set out to enable tokenization of real-estate (pulled from Zillow RapidAPI), where investors can buy and sell assets as seamless as buying and selling securities on the stock market. 

## Project Overview: 
### The Current Problem: 
Private-Equity transactions in general take time, energy, effort, and documentation between financial institutions to enable transition between sellers to potential buyers. 

### The Solution: 
Our process aims to cut out the bureaucracy when conducting private-equity like transactions. For our example, we chose real-estate as our example to showcase the simplicity to provide investors the ability to purchase or sell houses as NFT.
